<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Book Notes allows users to log books they’ve read. Each entry includes the book’s rating, the date the user finished reading it, personal notes, and a cover image retrieved using the Open Library API. The book data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, which users need to set up themselves. Environment variables can be configured to connect the app to the user's PostgreSQL instance.
